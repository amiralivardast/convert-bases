#### Description:
This project is a simple web application implemented using the Flask framework in Python. The main purpose of this program is to convert numbers from hexadecimal to octal, binary and
decimal and vice versa. For this purpose, functions have been considered to convert numbers between these systems. First, an object of the Flask class is created and used as the main name
of the application. Then different methods are defined to convert numbers between hexadecimal, binary, octal and decimal number system. These methods convert numbers using default Python
functions such as int(), bin(), hex(), and oct(). Then two other methods named index and error are defined as web paths. The index method is used for the main page of the program and it
contains the necessary commands to receive inputs from page forms, apply conversion functions as needed and display the results to the user. The error method is also used to display an
error message if invalid numbers are entered into the conversion functions. In the HTML part of the web page, forms and input fields are defined for each numerical system and display the
conversion results in different parts of the page. Also, Jinja capabilities have been used to display the results of calculations in the relevant fields. This program can be run and tested
in debug mode, and by running the main file, the Flask server will be turned on and the program will be available. This project is a simple example of using the Flask framework to convert
numbers between different number systems. Using the methods and functions in this project, you can convert numbers between hexadecimal, binary, octal and decimal number systems and view
the results on a web page. In the Python codes of this project, there are 12 functions related to base conversion, each of which converts one base to another, for example, there is a
function that converts base 2 to base 10, or there is another function that converts base 16 to base 2. It turns out that 12 functions are written for all of these to be used in the main
program. In the CSS codes of this project, specifications are considered for the H1 tag, for example, the size of this tag or the color of this tag. In the background of this page, the
color #d8ba94 is used, and its combination with the color of the header, which is #393939, is a good combination. In the following CSS codes for input tags, specifications are also
considered, one of which is the position of the text, for example, in the middle of the box or on the side. Another input specification for the hover is what happens when the user hovers
over it. There are many specifications for the submit buttons, one of which is the size of the line and the other is the color around it, which, like the header of the page, uses color
#393939 inside it. In the following codes, there are specifications for the number button written in the tags, one of this kind, and that is the input tag for converting base 10 to other
bases, whose specifications are the same as other input tags, and only its type is different because The user just enters a number.
